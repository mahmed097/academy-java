		 * What I've learned in this lesson is how to use Math.random to generate a
		 * random number. One issue I had is that I got an error when I tried to create
		 * an int variable to store my random variable. Math.random() produces a double
		 * value, thus I had to change my variable to a double. From this lession I make
		 * sure to remember that Math.random() produces a double numeber and not an intr
		 * number.
